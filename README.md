# Docker UI
### Ever wished you could manage your docker containers from a simple web UI?
Now you can!

This project aims to simplify the workflow, when working with docker compose files / docker stacks.
Easily manage your containers, create compose files without writing a single line of code (WiP) or just change a deployment and all of that just in your browser.

The entire project is developed from the ground up, using Fastapi, Svelte and the docker sdk at its core. It's designed in a modular manner making adding features fast and easy.

    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker:ro
    restart: always
